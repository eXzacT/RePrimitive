RePrimitive is a blender addon that allows you to tweak primitive shapes at any point in time.<br />
It works despite the object location/rotation and it even works if they are applied. All this with a single action.<br />

## Usage

You can use the addon with keybinds, by default it's CTRL+ALT+A for tweaking primitives and CTRL+ALT+R to fix rotation.<br />
If you don't like using keybinds there are two buttons inside RePrimitive panel on the side if you have it enabled.

### _RePrimitive main operator_

Once you press the keybind or button for RePrimitive main operator you will get a popup window which allows you to change all the details.

Now you can either click OK or press on the side, both of these actions will show the same window but it will be locked in the bottom left.
If you wanted to get the window popup again you would just use the keybind/click the RePrimitive button again.

### _Fix applied rotation operator_

To fix the primitive shape rotation all you have to do is select it and press the keybind/button from OBJECT mode.<br />
The rotation could also be fixed from EDIT mode but make sure nothing is selected OR select the face/faces you would want to be on top yourself.<br />
This was intended for complex shapes however, for primitive shapes I suggest you select nothing in EDIT mode or do it from OBJECT mode

In case of a monkey head or any other complex shape fixing rotation from object mode most likely will not work.<br />
Instead you have to go to edit mode and select the face or faces you would like to be on top.<br />
You could also select the vert.
